# Stack Size Controller (Optimized Version)

‚ö† **Disclaimer:** This is **not the official version** of the Stack Size Controller plugin. The original plugin has not received updates for a while, so I have optimized and improved its performance for better efficiency. I do not claim ownership of the original plugin‚Äîthis is just a refined version for those who need an updated and optimized release.

## üîß Features & Improvements
- Optimized stack size handling for better performance.
- Cleaned up and refactored the code for maintainability.
- Improved efficiency while keeping the original functionality intact.

## üìå Installation
1. Download the `StackSizeController.cs` file.
2. Place it into your Rust plugin directory (`oxide/plugins/`).
3. Reload the plugin using `oxide.reload StackSizeController` or restart your server.

## ‚ùó Notes
- This version is **not officially maintained** by the original developer.
- If the official plugin receives an update, consider using that version instead.
- Feel free to report any issues or suggest further optimizations.
